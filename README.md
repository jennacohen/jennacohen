# 👋🏼 Welcome to my GitHub!

👩🏻‍💻 I am a visual journalist specializing in digital & product design, data visualization, graphics, and animation.

📰 I'm currently an [Associate Product Manager](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/jenna-cohen) on the digital team at [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/). I work on the design and UX of our website and work alongside our editorial staff and engineers to manage updates and strategize future product iterations. 

I started at PBS News Hour as a [Roy W. Howard Fellow](https://scripps.com/fund/news/scripps-howard-foundation-announces-newest-class-of-roy-w-howard-fellows/) and have previously worked as a digital designer at the [Howard Center for Investigative Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/howard-center-for-investigative-journalism) and [Capital News Service](https://cnsmaryland.org/) at the University of Maryland.
