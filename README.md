### Welcome to my GitHub! 

I am a visual journalist specializing in data visualization, web design, graphics, and animation.

I'm currently a Roy W. Howard Fellow on the digital team at the PBS NewsHour, but previously worked as a digital designer at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and Capital News Service at the University of Maryland.
